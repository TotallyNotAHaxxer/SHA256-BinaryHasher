# Binary Hashing

A simple binary hasher I made that can take about any binary file and computer a SHA256 hash for it. 

# Purpose

The purpose of this program is to generate hashes for programs that use client-client or internal binary integrity systems but also use client-server binary integrity systems. 

# Setup

Just run Visual Studio, load the SLN file, set the properties to be C++20, Release, X86 and you are good to go!

# Calling the application

Call the exe in a new cmd window followed by the location of the application you want to hash
